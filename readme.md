Hello,

this project was made to solve test located https://github.com/teamleadercrm/coding-test/blob/master/1-discounts.md .

The solution has been achieved using the PHP Framework, Laravel.

In order to run this, I've used Homestead, the instalation guide can be found here :

Homestead https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/homestead

Laravel https://laravel.com/docs/5.6

To migrate customers and products data to the database, you'll need to run
**php artisan migrate** and 
**php artisan db:seed**

If you need me to provide some explanations about the solution, you can find me at _**ion.turcanu@stefanini.com**_

Kind regards,

Ion
